<h2 id="support-troubleshooting-heading">Troubleshooting &amp; known issues</h2>
<p>Use this section to confirm whether a problem stems from configuration,
outages, or a documented limitation [ref:troubleshooting].</p>
<p>Check the guides and status page first; many reports resolve through
updates or account settings [ref:troubleshooting].</p>
<p>If the issue persists, gather logs or screenshots and submit a ticket so
engineering can review [ref:troubleshooting].</p>
