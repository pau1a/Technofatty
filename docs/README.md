# Technofatty Internal Docs

⚠️ **Collaborator-only. This folder is not for public consumption.**

This is our **lab notebook + compass** for how Technofatty evolves.

---

## Core Mandates
- [`strategy.md`](strategy.md) → our overarching site strategy and neural-net model.  
- [`knowledge.md`](knowledge.md) → documentation of the Knowledge segment (articles, taxonomy, SEO/structured data).  
- [`tools.md`](tools.md) → playbook for ideating, logging, and prioritising business tools.  
- [`blog.md`](blog.md) → framing and guidance for blog entries (positioning, tie-ins, tone).  

---

## How to Use
- Treat these docs as **aide-memoires** for collaborators.  
- Capture *everything* — ideas, patterns, experiments, even half-baked gems.  
- Don’t worry about polish: this is our **gold dust sieve**.  
- Cross-link aggressively between sections: the power is in the neural net.

✦ Remember: none of this is public messaging. These docs are for us to keep continuity, so we never lose what we surfaced in conversation.
