# Technofatty Internal Docs

This folder is the aide-memoire for collaborators. It is not public messaging. It records how we think, decide, and build so context never evaporates.

## Map
Strategy → `strategy.md`  
Tools (product line) → `tools.md`  
Knowledge (content system) → `knowledge.md`  
Blog (editorial tie-ins) → `blog.md`  
Telemetry & data layer → `telemetry.md`  
PR & release hygiene → `pr-playbook.md`
Content template → `content-template.md`

## How to use this folder
Capture ideas as they surface. Link them across docs rather than duplicating. Prefer small, frequent commits that keep rationale next to decisions.

## Promise to ourselves
We will surface and retain every flake of gold dust. These docs exist to prevent strategic and architectural drift.
