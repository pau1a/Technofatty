# Technofatty Community – Moderation & Governance Policy

This document defines the moderation and governance standards for the Technofatty Community.
Moderation is a trust-critical function. Rules here are binding and deviations require stakeholder approval.

---

## 1. Moderation Roles

- **Staff Moderators**: Technofatty employees with full moderation rights.
- **Community Moderators (future phase)**: Selected members with limited rights, added only after stakeholder approval.
- **Contributors**: Regular users; may flag posts but have no authority.

---

## 2. First-Post Approval

- All new accounts require **first-post approval** by a Staff Moderator before publication.
- Posts awaiting approval are hidden from public view.
- Moderators must check for:
  - Clear title and body (see content brief).
  - Proper tags (taxonomy alignment).
  - Compliance with Code of Conduct.
- Approved posts are published immediately; rejected posts return with feedback.

---

## 3. Spam & Abuse Safeguards

- **Rate limits**:
  - 1 post/minute max for new users.
  - Max 1 link per post until the account has ≥3 approved posts.
- **Link checks**: Outbound links must be relevant; spam domains must be blacklisted.
- **Uploads**:
  - Only image uploads allowed at launch.
  - Max 1 MB per image.
  - No attachments or executables.
- **Auto-flags**: Posts with more than 2 external links are automatically flagged for review.

---

## 4. Code of Conduct Enforcement

- A visible **“Report” button** must appear on all posts and replies.
- Reports are triaged by Staff Moderators within 48 hours.
- Violations include: harassment, hate speech, spam, off-topic promotion.
- First offense: warning.
- Second offense: suspension.
- Severe violations: immediate permanent ban.

---

## 5. Staff Moderation Standards

- **Transparency**: Moderators must leave a visible note when editing a post (e.g. “Edited by staff for clarity”).
- **Professional Tone**: Replies from staff must be labeled “Technofatty Staff.”
- **Neutrality**: Staff may enforce rules but not editorialize or bias answers.

---

## 6. Governance Principles

- **Consistency**: All moderation decisions must apply uniformly across users.
- **Appeals**: Suspended or banned users may appeal via support@technofatty.com.
- **Audit**: Moderation logs must record every action (approve, reject, edit, suspend). Logs retained ≥12 months.

---

## 7. Integration with Consent & Privacy

- All moderation actions must respect privacy policies.
- Email addresses are never shown publicly.
- Consent for data processing must remain gated by ConsentMiddleware.

---

## 8. Release Criteria

The Community cannot launch unless:
- First-post approval system is functional.
- Report button works and routes to staff moderation queue.
- Rate limits and spam checks are enforced.
- Code of Conduct is published and linked in hub, threads, and post form.

*Moderation is not optional. It is brand protection. The Technofatty Community is a professional space, and governance must reflect that at every stage.*
