# Knowledge: System and Practice

Knowledge is our durable reference. It explains concepts crisply, links to the right tools, and avoids fluff.

## Article subtypes
Guide (how-to), Glossary (definition), Signal (short, time-sensitive), Quick-win (fast tactic). These are reflected in `SubtypeChoices` and used for filtering and page layout variants.

## Publish semantics
Only `status=published` and `published_at<=now` are surfaced. Future-dated content is permissible and auto-published by the management command when due.

## Metadata and structured data
Each article sets `meta_title`, `meta_description`, canonical URL, and OpenGraph/Twitter fields. JSON-LD lives inline in the article template for BlogPosting and breadcrumbs. Inline is acceptable because it’s deterministic, minimal, and audited.

## Slugs and uniqueness
Slugs are unique globally for routing flexibility. Autogenerated if absent. Changing a slug is exceptional; add redirects if we ever allow it.

## Interconnection rules
– Every Guide includes a “Try it now” card for the relevant tool.  
– Glossary entries are short and always link outward to a Guide.  
– Signals expire from navigation but remain addressable.  
– Quick-wins must be runnable in under five minutes.

## Editorial style
Short first paragraph that earns the click. No throat-clearing. Prefer examples. One diagram beats three paragraphs.

## Template contract (excerpt)
```django
{% include "coresite/partials/seo/meta_head.html" with
   page_title=article.meta_title|default:article.title
   meta_description=article.meta_description|default:article.blurb|default:'' 
   og_type='article'
   canonical_url=article.canonical_url|default:canonical_url
   meta_robots=meta_robots %}
```

## Admin affordances
– CKEditor for `content`.  
– Bulk actions: Publish (auto-sets `published_at`), Archive.  
– Preview link (`?preview=1`) for staff bypassing published filter.

## Quality gates for PRs
An article PR states: user problem, what the reader can do next, the tool link, and the two most likely failure modes.
