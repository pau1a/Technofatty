# SEO and Sitemap Policies

This project enforces a strict sitemap validation policy. The canonical host is `technofatty.com` and all URLs must use HTTPS and include a trailing slash. Query strings are not allowed except for `page`.

The test suite reads `docs/seo/retired_endpoints.txt` to ensure retired paths never appear in the sitemap.
