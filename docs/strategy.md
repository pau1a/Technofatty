# Strategy: Neural Site Model

The site is a working system, not a brochure. Its parts (Knowledge, Tools, Blog, Conversions) interconnect like a neural net so that every path a user takes increases their likelihood of achieving value and us achieving revenue.

## Objectives
Generate qualified conversations and paid outcomes without resorting to thin SEO bait. We do it by shipping real utility (Tools), real expertise (Knowledge), and opinionated narrative (Blog) that constantly reinforce one another.

## Pillars
1) **Utility first**: Tools that solve an actual business job are the primary magnets.  
2) **Narrative clarity**: Blog pieces frame the why, trade-offs, and when-to-use of those tools and patterns.  
3) **Codified expertise**: Knowledge articles are referenceable, structured, and fast to navigate, not streams of thought.  
4) **Zero dead-ends**: Every page type proposes a next best action that is contextual, not generic.

## Neural linking (how pages “think” together)
• Article → Tool: If an article cites a technique with hands-on value, the tool card appears inline as a step (“Try it now”).  
• Tool → Article: Each tool outputs a “Learn more” sidebar that deep-links to two articles: one conceptual, one operational.  
• Blog → Article/Tool: A blog post states a point of view and then routes to the relevant tool and the canonical article.  
• Tool result → CTA: After a result, we offer exactly one conversion that matches intent: subscribe for updates on that capability, or book a consult if the user’s inputs suggest complexity.

## Taxonomy (shared across sections)
Business Domain (e.g. Pricing, Sourcing, Ops) → Capability (e.g. Forecasting, Classification) → Modality (Tool | Guide | Signal | Quick-win) → Tags. The taxonomy powers cross-links and on-page “related” blocks. Keep it sparse and durable.

## Monetisation paths (without harming trust)
• Free forever tools with rate limits.  
• Paid tiers for volume, API, or “save & schedule”.  
• Advisory add-on where the tool signals high stakes and ambiguity.  
• Sponsorship is permissible only if the sponsor’s product is used in the tool or reproducible by an alternative; disclosures must be explicit.

## Guardrails
• Never ship a tool that can’t be explained in 30 seconds with an input/output example.  
• Do not add a tag unless at least two pages share it.  
• Structured data belongs to the page template, not ad-hoc.

## Metrics that matter
Time-to-first-value per tool session, completion rate, assisted conversions (tool → form/booking), return visits to a capability, and percent of sessions that traverse at least two pillars (e.g. Tool then Knowledge).

## Governance
Every PR that touches content or tools must include: purpose, user job, next best action, and telemetry events added. See `pr-playbook.md`.
