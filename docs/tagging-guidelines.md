# Categories and Tags Guidelines

This guide defines the allowed content categories and tags across Technofatty and how to use them consistently.

## Allowed Categories
Categories partition content by business domain. They are tightly controlled and should only change through strategic review.

| Category Title       | Slug                | Usage                             |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Pricing & Forecasting| `pricing-forecasting` | Pricing strategy, revenue modelling, margin analysis. |
| Sales Ops            | `sales-ops`          | Pipeline, CRM hygiene, enablement processes. |
| Content Ops          | `content-ops`        | Editorial workflow, repurposing, distribution. |
| Finance Ops          | `finance-ops`        | Budgeting, variance analysis, cash management. |

## Tag Naming Conventions
- Tags are lowercase slugs using hyphens for spaces (`margin-optimization`).
- Keep tags short (1–3 words) and use singular nouns (`forecast`, `automation`).
- Avoid synonyms that fragment clusters; reuse existing tags when possible.
- Each piece should carry 2–4 tags that describe enduring topics.

### Examples
| Tag             | Notes                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| `pricing`       | Cross-links all pricing content regardless of modality. |
| `automation`    | Used by tools and guides covering automated workflows. |
| `salesops`      | Connects sales operations threads, articles, and tools. |

## Creating New Tags
Create a new tag only when:
1. The concept is not covered by an existing tag.
2. At least two planned or published pieces (Knowledge, Tool, Blog, or Case Study) will use it.
3. The tag represents a durable topic, not a campaign or temporary trend.

Before adding a tag, search the repository to ensure no existing tag covers the idea. Merge near‑duplicates (`sales-ops` vs `salesops`) and prefer the canonical form listed above.

## Relation to Knowledge/Tools Clusters
Tags form cross‑type clusters that bind **Knowledge** articles and **Tools** around the same capability. A healthy cluster has:
- One or more Knowledge entries explaining the concept.
- At least one Tool that applies it.
- Optional Blog posts or Case Studies narrating outcomes.

Categories provide vertical organisation inside each content type, while tags knit those sections together. When introducing a new tool or article, choose tags that connect it into existing clusters; add a new tag only if a new cluster is being intentionally seeded.
